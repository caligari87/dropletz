# DropletZ
A simple and classy blood mod using procedural blood spray instead of large, garish "mass of blood" decals.

Despite being a clone, none of SidDoyle's original code for the Droplets blood mod ([archived here](https://github.com/caligari87/droplets)) is being used. Much like my other reimplementation, [DarkDoomZ](https://github.com/caligari87/darkdoomz), DropletZ is being built from scratch using the more powerful options provided by ZScript, additionally implementing some changes to fit my own vision of the idea.
